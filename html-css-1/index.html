            Elephants are highly intelligent animals whose continued existence is 
            threatened. Loss of habitat, human-elephant conflict, and poaching for
             ivory and bushmeat are great threats to elephant populations. As of 2013,
              the Asian elephant population had experienced a 90 percent decline in the past 100
               years and some experts suggest 95 percent of their original habitat has been 
               lost over the same period. Estimates vary, but most agree that there has been a 
               75 percent decline in the elephant population in Africa. Today there are thought 
               to be between 300,000 and 500,000 wild elephants in Africa and less than 60,000 
               wild elephants in Asia. Asian elephants are recognized as an endangered species.
                African elephants are recognized as threatened.
